# Truth Table iOS App <img src="Images/Icon.png" height="25"/>

This project was created during the Knight Hacks Hack-a-thon at UCF in March 2019.

The goal of this project is to generate truth tables given a propositional logic formula. This would help reduce manual labor of college students taking classes such as discrete math.

Equations are stored in `UserDefaults`, so they persist even after the application is quit.
